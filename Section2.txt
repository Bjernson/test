CLOUDWATCH

Can Monitor:
		Compute
		EBS
		Database and Analytics
		Others (billing, Sns SQS)

Host level metrics by default:
	CPU
	Network
	Disk I/O only
	Status Check
	RAM (Custom)
	VM Disk (Custom)

Monitoring Interval:
	5 minutes default
	1 minute if you enable detailed monitoring

Retention Rate:
	Indefinite (Default)
	Can set log rotation
	Can retrieve metrics from terminated EC2 or ELB
	
Alarms:
	Can be made per monitored metric
	Can set threshold per alarm
	Can set action per threshold breached

Note:
	Can be used on-premise install SSM and cloudwatch agent

Monitoring EC2
To enable custom metrics:
	1. Create IAM Role allowing EC2 service to access cloudwatch
	2. Add IAM role to launched instance
	3. Run perl script for posting instance data to cloudwatch
	4. Add the perl script to crontab to execute the script every minute

	
EBS
	GP2 - General Purpose SSD
		1GB up to 16TB
		10000 IOPS Max
		1 IOPS per GB of Disk Size
		Can burst IOPS up to 3000 using I/O Credits
			IOPS higher than 3000 can only be achieved by increasing disk size
			Initial I/O Credits per volume can sustain burst of 3000 up to 30 minutes
	
	io1 - Provisioned IOPS SSD
		4GB up to 16TB
		64000 IOPS Max 
		
	st1 - Throughput Optimized HDD
		500GB up to 16TB
		500 IOPS Max
		Lower Price
		For Big Data and log processing
		
	sc1 - Cold HDD
		500 GB up to 16TB
		250 IOPS Max
		Lowest Price
		Infrequently acccessed data such as file server

Prewarming EBS 
	Or called initialization, accesses all storage blocks on the volume once
	For newly created volumes, no longer necessary
	For volumes restored from snapshots pulled from S3 this can still be done
	
	
Monitoring EBS
	Metrics
		Volume Read/Write Ops
			To get this, Get IOPS in graph divided by period i.e total / 300 seconds for 5 minute period
		Volume Queue Length
			Number of operations waiting to be completed
			should be 0 most of the time
	
	Status Checks
		Ok
		warning - performance degradation
		impaired - stalled
		insufficient data
		
Modying EBS
	For newer generation EC2 flavors, you can now modify attached volumes:
		Type
		Size
		IOPS

Monitoring ELB
	Ways to Monitor
		Cloudwatch metrics
		access logs
		request tracing
		Cloudtrail Logs
	
	Cloudwatch metrics
		Upon creation of load balancer and assignment of target
			default metrics will be populated in monitoring tab of the ELB
			AWS will send ELB metrics to cloudwatch
			
	Access Logs
		When you enable access log monitoring
			can select 1 minute or 60 minute interval 
			need to set s3 bucket for storage must be located in same region (or have AWS create the s3 location automatically)
			can still store data where an ec2 instance has been deleted behind an autoscaling group
			
	Request Tracing
		For Application Load balancers only
		AWS adds a header to the http request X-Amzn-Trace-ID
	
	Cloud Trail
		Audit logs of API calls within AWS services  
		
Monitoring Elasticache

	Things to look at:
		CPU Util
		SWAP usage
		Evictions
		Concurrent Connections

	Memcached
		CPU
		Multithreaded
		can handle CPU Util up to 90%
		when reached, need to add nodes to cluster
		
		SWAP
		Should be 0 most of the time and not exceed 50MB
		If it exceeds, increase memcached_connections_overhead parameter
		
		EVICTIONS
		No recommended setting
		Scale up or Scale out
		
		Concurrent Connections
		No recommended setting
		large number means a huge traffic spike or application is not releasing connections
		
	Redis
		CPU
		Not Multithreaded
		CPU Util threshold is 90 / # of cores
		
		SWAP
		No SwapUsage metric, use reserved-memory instead
		
		EVICTIONS
		No recommended setting
		scale out
		
		Concurrent Connections
		No recommended setting
		large number means a huge traffic spike or application is not releasing connections

Cloudwatch custom dashboards
	
	Dashboard has global visibility
	BUT you need to change to specific region to add metrics from that region
	
Billing Alarms
	Receive billing alerts
	Receive billing reports and save to S3 bucket
	Set total cost exceeds a set amount for the month
	set email address to receive, and confirm email

AWS Organizations
	Used for management of multiple AWS accounts
	
	Allows
		Central Management of policies across multiple AWS accounts
			Create account groups and apply policies
			
		Control access to AWS services
			Create Service Control Policies (SCP) and apply them to account groups
			SCP overrides service control from IAM
			
		Automate AWS Account Creation and Management
			inherits policies applied to groups for new accounts
			
		Consolidate Billing across accounts
			Consolidate charging reports
			get pricing benefits from aggregated usage
			
AWS Tagging and Resource Groups
	
	Tags
		Case Sensitive
		Key Value Pairs attached to AWS Resources
		Metadata
		Can sometimes be inherited i.e. Auto-Scaling, CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk
	
	Resource Groups
		Group Resources based on Tags
		contain info such as:
			Region
			Name
			Healthcheck
		
		Specific Information:
			for EC2 - priv/pub IP address
			for ELB - port config
			for RDS - DB Engine etc
	
	Types
		Classic
			Global
			
		AWS Systems Manager
			Per Region
			Can execute operations on the resources belonging to that group

EC2 Pricing
	
	On Demand
		Low Cost and flexibility
		per second/hour payment
		
	Reserved
		steady state and predictable usage
		up front payments to reduce compute cost
		Standard RIs up to 75% discount
		Convertibe RI up to 54% allow change attribute of the instance to equal or larger
		Scheduled RI
		1 year to 3 year terms
	
	SPOT
		flexible start and end times
		very low compute price
		for urgent computing needs that need large capacity
		
	Dedicated Hosts
		Not Multi tenant
		for regulatory requirements
		licensing requirements
		Can be purchased hourly
		or Reserved up to 70%
		
	
		
AWS_Config
	
	Managed service that enables
		AWS Resource inventory
		AWS Config history
		AWS Change Notifications
	
	Provides:
		Config Snapshots, logs config changes
		Automated compliance checking
	
	
	Components:
		Config Dashboard
		Config Rules
			Managed
			Custom
		Resources
		Settings
		
	Terminology:
		Configuration Item
			Point in time attribute of a resource
			
		Configuration snapshots
			Collection of config items
			
		Config Stream
			Stream of changed config items
			
		Config History
			Collection of config items for a resource over time
			
		Config Recorder
			Configuration of the config that records and stores config items
			Logs Config for account in each region
			Stores in s3
			notified via sns
	
	What can be seen:
		Resource:
			Type
			ID
		
		Compliance
		Timeline which contains:
			Config Details
			Relationships (which ec2 instance is the sec group attached)
			Changes
			CloudTrail event
		
	Compliance Checks:
		Triggers:
			Periodic
			Config Snapshot delivery (filterable)
		
		Managed Rules
			About 40
			Basic but fundamental
			
	Permissions needed:
		
		IAM Role that allows:
			Read permission to the recorded resources
			Write Access to S3 logging bucket
			Publish Access to Sns
		
		Console will optionally create this automatically
	
	Restrict Access:
		
		Only admins have full access
		Operators need only read-only permissions
		Enforce correct IAM policies for users
		
	Monitoring Config:
		CloudTrail check actions done to config i.e. stopping config recorder

Health Dashboards
	
	Service Health
		Shows service health of AWS service per region
		status.amazon.com
		Can show continental information
		
	Personal Health
		provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you
