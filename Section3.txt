Deploying EC2
	Notes:
	Placement Group - allows deployment to single AZ, increasing higher network throughput and lower latency
	Requesting Spot Instances - can request more than 1 instance but will not launch if the requested number of instances is not available

	Launch Issues
	
		InstanceLimitExceeded
			Reached number of instances you can run per region by default 20
			Can request increase per region
		
		InsufficientInstanceCapacity
			AWS does not currently have enough on-demand capacity that you are requesting
			To Resolve
				Wait for a few minutes to try again
				Request fewer instances
				Select different instance type
				Purchase RIs
				Submit a request without specifying AZ

	GP2 - General Purpose SSD
		1GB up to 16TB
		16000 IOPS Max
		min 100IOPS
		3 IOPS per GB of Disk Size
		Can burst IOPS up to 3000 using I/O Credits
			IOPS higher than 3000 can only be achieved by increasing disk size
			Initial I/O Credits per volume can sustain burst of 3000 up to 30 minutes
	
	io1 - Provisioned IOPS SSD
		4GB up to 16TB
		50 IOPS/GB
		64000 IOPS Max 
		
	st1 - Throughput Optimized HDD
		500GB up to 16TB
		500 IOPS Max
		Lower Price
		For Big Data and log processing
		
	sc1 - Cold HDD
		500 GB up to 16TB
		250 IOPS Max
		Lowest Price
		Infrequently acccessed data such as file server
		
	Hitting the IOPS Limit
		IO queuing
		To solve
			Increase volume size but only until 5.2TB for gp2 vols
			but if you need more than 16000 need IO1 type

Bastion Hosts - remember hehe

ELB
	Application Load Balancer
		Layer 7 LB
		for http and https traffic
		advanced request routing based on http/https headers
		IP is changed when it scales
	
	Network Load Balancer
		Layer 4
		TCP load balancer
		Faster performance millions RPS and lower latencies
		Can map to a static IP per subnet 
		Get both benefits by attaching an ALB behind an NLB
		
	Classic
		Legacy
		Not recommended
		very basic access to layer 7 headers
		can also do pure layer4 but slower than NLB
	
	Pre-Warming
		Contact AWS to pre-warm ELB
		give expected level of traffic
			Start and end dates
			Expected RPS
			Total Size of a typical request
		Normally ELB can adapt to gradually increasing traffic
	
	
	Error Messages
		4xx
			Client Side Error
			400 Malformed/Bad wrong format of request
			401 Unauthorized - user access denied
			403 Forbidden - Blocked via ACL
			460 Client Closed connection before load balancer can respond, client timeout may be too short
			463 Received X-Forwarded-For with more than 30 IP addresses
			
		5xx
			Server Side Error
			500 Internal Server error - error on loadbalancer
			502 Bad Gateway - App Server error, sent back a malformed response to the ELB
			503 Service Unavailable - no registered targets
			504 Gateway Timeout - app is not responding, issue in app/db
			561 Unauthorized - received an error code from the ID provider when trying to authenticate user
			
	CloudWatch Metrics
		Upon creation of load balancer and assignment of target
			default metrics will be populated in monitoring tab of the ELB
			AWS will send ELB metrics to cloudwatch as well as metrics for backend instances
		
		Can create alarm to perform a specific action
		Are gathered at 1 minute intervals
		
		Metrics
			BackendConnectionErrors
			HealthyHostCount
			UnhealthyHostCount
			HTTP_CODE_BACKEND_2xx,3xx,4xx,5xx
			Latency
			Request Count
			SurgeQueueLength (Classic) number of pending requests max queue size is 1024
			SpilloverCount (Classic) number of rejected requests due to maxed out queue
	
	Deploying ALB
		Listeners
			Port listener which should be the port that clients use to connect to the ALB
		
		AZs
			Enables ELB on the AZ you specify
			Increases Availability when choosing multiple AZ
		
		Security Groups
			Make sure the SG is open to clients IP with port specified in your listener
			Make sure SG can connect to backend server
		
		Target Group
			allows you to select target port/protocol
		
		Target Type
			Instance allows you to choose via Instance ID
			IP allows you to specify the specific IP address
			
		Health Check
			Specify the protocol the ALB uses to connect to the backend server
			Specify the path being served by the backend server
		
		Post Check
			State should be active
			Backend service should be accessible via DNS A record of ALB
