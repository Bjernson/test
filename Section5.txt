			Stored in a bucket in the same region
		Assign tags for cost tracking etc.
		Object-level API logging via cloudtrail 
		Encryption
			use AWS KMS 
			use AWS S3 Managed Keys
			All Server side and at rest
		Enable Cloudwatch Metrics
		
		PERMISSIONS
		By default public access is blocked
		
	Per Object:
		Has its own link
		has its own Permission options
		has own encryption options
		
S3 Lifecycle Policies
	Manage objects using most cost effective option
		Transitioning objects to different tiers
		Archive through glacier
		Delete
		
	Rules based on object object creation date i.e. 90 days after creation
	
MFA Delete and Versioning
	Versioning
		Enable revert to older version
		deletes ONLY apply a delete marker
		to permanently delete, delete version ID
		
	MFA Delete
		additional layer of protection to S3 versioning
		need MFA authentication to delete an object versioning
		need MFA auth to suspend or reenable versioning
		can use same MFA used in IAM for user auth

S3 Encryption
	Types
		In Transit
			SSL/TLS - Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security
			TLS is updated version of SSL
		At Rest
			Server side 
				SSE-S3 Server side encryption S3 Managed Keys
					all AES 256 encryption
					keys used per object
					keys are reencrypted using master key which has key rotation
				AWS KMS
					Separate permission to create envelope key which reencrypts your keys
					Audit trail when using your key
				SSE-C Server side encryption with customer provided keys
					AWS handles encryption/decryption
					Client handles key management
			
		Client Side Encryption
			Customer encrypt files before uploading
			
	
	ENFORCING S3 ENCRYPTION
		PUT REQUEST CONTENTS
			DNS bucket name
			Date
			Auth string
			Content Type
			Content Length
			MetaData
			Expect 100 continue 
			
		If file in encrypted at upload time:
			x-amz-server-side-encryption header should be included
			the header value has 2 options:
				AES256 - SSE-S3
				ams:kms - SSE-KMS
			Can add bucket policy to require uploads to have the header
			
	REVIEW: paano nalalaman via header kung anong key via KMS yung gagamitin???? Lol apparently via GUI padin pag nag upload ka
	
S3 Encryption Lab Notes
	Can enable upon bucket creation - encrypts files upon upload to S3
	Can create bucket policy to require encryption upon upload
		Create s3 bucket policy
		Deny
		Principal is '*' for all requests
		AWS service is amazon s3
		action is Put Object
		ARN is your bucket ARN
		Add Condition
			Condition String not equals
			Key is x-amz-server-side-encryption
			value is required encryption type i.e aws-kms
			
		WEIRD: Error may appear saying action does not apply to any resource/s in statement
			existing naman yung ARN
			need daw appendan ng /* yung ARN para tanggapin as valid policy
	
	Upon upload
		You can choose encryption type for the file
		Returns 403 when header is not present
		
EC2 Volume Types
	Ephemeral (Instance-Store)
		Data Gets Lost when:
			Failure of an underlying drive
			Stopping an EBS backed instance with Ephemeral additional volumes
			Terminating an instance
		Instance attributes are fixed for life
		Do not rely for long term data
		
	EBS
		Upgradeable instance while instance is stopped
		
	Root - OS Drive
		can be EBS or Ephemeral
		Ephemeral 
			only up to 10GB
			deleted upon instance termination
			Cannot be stopped, can only be rebooted or deleted
		EBS 
			up to 2 TB
			EBS backed will be deleted upon instance termination by DEFAULT but can be SET OTHERWISE
			Can be stopped
	 
	Additional Volumes - D:/ /dev/sdb etc.
		EBS
			will NOT be deleted upon instance termination
		ephemeral 
			deleted upon instance termination

EBS Volumes Lab Notes
	EC2 and EBS need to be at same AZ
	EBS Volumes can be modified on the fly
		type and size w/o downtime (has performance impact during migration)
		except standard(magnetic)
	To migrate instance with EBS volumes to different AZ
		snapshot the EBS volumes first
		Create a new volume from snapshot with target AZ
		Create an image from the EBS snapshot
		Launch instance using the new image
	Snapshots can be copied to different region (for transfer of instance to different region)
	Or create the AMI from the snapshot then Copy the AMI across regions
	Snapshots exist in S3 (no user visibility though)
	Snapshots are incremental
	To snapshot an EBS root device, best practice is to stop the instance first BUT you can do it on the fly
	You can create AMI from both Image and Snapshots (Nasa slides pero parang redundant AMI from image????)
	
EBS Encryption and Downtime
	For most AWS resources, encryption can only be enabled at creation
	for EFS
		If you want to encypt an already existing EFS
		Create a new one and then migrate
	for RDS
		Same as EFS
	for EBS
		Same as EFS
		Cannot disable encryption once encypted
		You can migrate data between encrypted and decrypted volumes
		If you want to encypt an existing volume
			snapshot
			copy snapshot with encryption enabled
			restore encrypted snapshot
			
	For S3
		Encryption anytime
		
KMS vs CloudHSM (Cloud Hardware Security Modules)
	Both used for Key Management
	Both offer high security levels
	Both HA
	
	KMS
		Shared hardware (multi-tenant)
		Multi tenancy should not be an issue
		Free-tire eligible
		Encrypt data in AWS S3,EBS,DynamoDB
		Symmetric algorithm - same algrotihm and key for encrytion/decryption
		
	HSM
		physical device
		protects confidentiality of your keys
		Dedicated Hardware
		no free-tier
		Within your own VPC
		FIPS 140-2 level 3 compliance and EAL-4
		For applications with strict regulatory requirements i.e financing 
		Encrypt data in AWS , AA, Document Signing, Etc. 
		Assymetric algorithm

AMIs
	
	provides all info need to launch an EC2 instance
		Template for the root volume
		Launch permissions (who can use)
		Block Device Mapping
	
	AWS provides a default selection of AMIs
	User can create custom AMIs
	AMI must be registered in order to be launched (Only used if the Image creation was done via CLI)
	Registered per region-basis
		
		
	Sharing
		Private, shared or public or even sell via AWS Marketplace
		By default is private
		Origin account has full control
		Origin account is charged for storage of AMI
		Owner must provide read permissions for the storage that backs the AMI (EBS or S3)
		If an AMI is copied, the copier will be charged for the AMI storage of that copy
		
	Copying
		Cannot directly copy an encrypted AMI shared by another account
			Need to copy the snapshot and reencrypt using own key
			So you need the original shapshot from the sharing account as well as the original encryption key
			Then copy from the original snapshot and reencrypt using your own key
			Then register it as a new AMI with you as the owner
		
		Cannot directly AMI with an associated billingproducts code
			Whether via subscription or via Licensing fee eg. Windows Redhat AMIs from AWS marketplace
			Can do it indirectly via creating an image from launched paid AMI
