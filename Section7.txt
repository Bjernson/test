DNS101
	VPCs are now ipv6 compatible
	Top level domain name --- .com .gov
	second level domains --- .co.uk --- the .co
	
	Domain registrar
		such as godaddy 123-reg.co.uk
		authority that can assign domain names under one or more top level domains
		enforces domain name uniqueness
		domain names are recorded in the WHOIS database
		
	SOA Records
		Name of the server that supplied the zone
		Administrator of the zone
		current version of the data file
		The duration in seconds where
			a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates
			a secondary name server should wait before retrying a failed zone transfer
			max seconds that a name server can use data before it must be refreshed or expire
			TTL on resource records
		
	NS Records
		Name server records
		used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to the content DNS servers which contain the authoritative DNS records
		
	A Records
		Address records
		translates human readable name to IP
		
	TTL record
		Length of time that a DNS record is cached
		Architectural notes:
			Before major cloud migration companies drop their TTL records to 300 seconds
			Wait for 2 days so that the new TTL setting of 300 seconds are reflected in the whole internet
			Then perform the migration
			
	CNames
		Canonical Name
		Resolve one domain name to another
		mobile.acloud.guru --> test.com 
		
	Alias Records (AWS ONLY)
		Similar to a CNames
		map one dns name to another
		Key DIFFERENCE with CNAME
			CNAME cannot be used for naked domain names (zone apex record) (review)
		normally maps apex zone to an ELB (CNAME based)
		
		
	Note: Always try to use an Alias record over CNAME because it is free
	
	LAB - NOTES
	
	Route 53 is global service
	Since AWS is now a domain registrar, you can now register a domain name through AWS console
		can take up to 3 days to complete
	When registered, it becomes a hosted zone
	By Default the hosted zone will have RRs
		NS - 4 different name servers across different top level domains 
		SOA 
	Per RR has
		DNS Record Type
		set as alias record?
		TTL
		value/s (per line)
		Routing Policy
	
	Routing Policies
		Simple
			One or multiple IP addresses per record
			If multiple, IP address returned is random (however remember that DNS records are cached)
			Cannot associate health checks
				
		Weighted
			Specify percentage of requests to different addresses
			Creating the record set
				weight value is not in percent, you specify number of requests which becomes a fraction of the integer sum of all weights (hahahaha)
					will only associate with other RRs with same name and type
				weight value is in whole numbers
				can be associated with healthchecks (review)
				you create multiple record sets per weight
			
		Latency based
			Routes based on lowest network latency for the client
			Creating the record set
				You need to create a resource record set on the regions which host your website
				when creating the RRs with this policy, the region is automatically determined based on public IP
				
		
		Failover
			active/passive setup
			setup a health check on the active
				Set Name
				Set what to monitor
					Endpoint
					Other healthcheck
					Cloudwatch alarm
				
				Specify endpoint by
					IP address or Domain Name
					Set
						Protocol
						IP address
						hostname
						port
						path
						
				Can create an alarm
				Can change request intervals
				Can change failure threshold
				
			Creating the record set
				Create record set with failover routing policy
				Associate health check with the record set
				Specify the Failover record type primary or secondary
				Normally only the primary has an associated health check
			
		Geolocation
			Routes based on client geographical area
			Creating the record set
				Set default location (review what happens when you dont have a default location and you access from PH hahahaha) apparently AWS will return no answer 
				Set location based on the IP address you put in the record set
		
		Multivalue answer
			Allows multiple record sets for one name
			up to 12 multivalue answer records per resource
			can associate health check per records
			Can respond with up to 8 healthy records per request
			Creating the record set
				Choose multivalue anwer policy
				Associate health check (optional)
			Used for mapping across multiple resources
