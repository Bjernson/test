AWS Marketplace security products
	AMIs for security
		WAFs
		Antivirus
		Firewalls
		etc
	Region Specific
	Kali Linux for Penetration testing
	Permission is Required for ALL PEN TESTS
	Different Prices
	CIS OS Hardening
	
IAM Custom Policies LAB NOTES
	AWS MAnaged Policies - Premade by AWS
	Can create by visual editor or by json
	Steps to create custom policy
		Choose Service
		Choose Action
			List
			Read
			Write
			Permissions
		Choose Resources
		Condition
	
	Then create Role
		For EC2
		Attach the custom policy in permissions

	Never use access key ID and Secret Access Keys for aws CLI auth within EC2. Use ROLES
	YOU CAN NOW ATTACH A ROLE INTO A LIVE RUNNING INSTANCE
	
	you can edit a policy attached, will take effect almost immediately
	
MFA and Reporting with IAM - LAB
	Can enable on root account
	Can take a picture of the original QR code as backup for the MFA
	Can enable per IAM user
		via AWS Console as normal
		via AWS CLI
			STEPS
				Instance needs to have full access to IAM
				aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device --virtual-mfa-device-name EC2-User --outfile /home/ec2-user/QRCode.png --bootstrap-method QRCodePNG
				aws iam enable-mfa-device --user-name EC2-User --serial-number arn:aws:iam::"USERNUMBERHERE":mfa/EC2-User --authentication-code-1 "CODE1HERE" --authentication-code-2 "CODE2HERE"
	
	You can use CLI wit MFA
		aws sts get-session-token commands
		
	Credential Report
		Shows all users
		auth methods used (MFA or not?)
		last auth timestamp
		
STS
	Security Token Service
	Grant Users temporary and limited access to AWS Resources
	Users can come from 3 sources
		Federation (typically AD)
			Uses SAML
			Gives rights based on AD no need for IAM account
			SSO
		Federate with Mobile Apps
			FB
			Amazon
			Google
			Open ID
		AWS Cross Account Access
		
	Federation
		Joining of users from different domains
		
	Identity Broker
		Service that allows identity information to be joined to a different auth domain
		
	Identity Store
		Services which store users such as AD and FB 
		
	Identities
		User
		
	STEPS for authentication
		User logs in application
		Application calls in an Identity Broker (Developed)
		Broker Auth first with 3rd party Identity Store to validate credentials
		Broker secures an STS token using GetFederationToken function call
			Broker must use IAM Credentials
			Call must include IAM Policy
			Call must include duration 1 to 36 hours
		STS confirms IAM policy attached to the AWS user used by the broker
		STS returns 4 values to the app
			AWS access key
			AWS secret access key
			Token
			Duration
		Broker Returns the values to the app
		Application uses the STS token to authenticate to AWS Service 
		IAM allows the AWS service to perform the operation
		
	
Logging - Security
	Services
		CloudTrail
		AWS Config
		AWS Cloudwatch logs
		VPC Flow Logs
	Recommend reading security at scale white paper
	
	Prevent Unauthorized access to log files
		Using IAM Users, groups, Roles, policies
		Using S3 bucket policies
		Using MFA
		
	Set Alerts when logs are created or fail to create using:
		CloudTrail Notifications
		AWS Config Rules
		
	Alerts should be specific but not divulge detail (show only log file location)
	
	Log changes to system components
		Using AWS Config Rules
		CloudTrail
	
	Set control to prevent log modification
		IAM and S3 policies
		CloudTrail log file validation
		CloudTrail log file encryption

AWS Hypervisors
	Run on Xen Hypervisors
	VMs run as
		PV Paravirtualization
			used to be faster
			guests don't have elevated access to CPU
			uses rings for privilege modes
				ring 0 hypervisor OS
				ring 1 Guest OS
				ring 3 applications

		HVM Hardware Virtual Machine
			full virtualization
			windows VMs
			HVM over PV when available
		
	Isolation
		Done trhough the firewall in Xen's Hypervisor
	
	Access
		Only Admins with business need to do so
		they use MFA
		logged and audited
		revoked when no longer needed
		
	Guest Access
		Customer Controlled
		AWS does not have any access rights
	
	Memory Scrubbing (EBS)
		When provisioned to a customer
		When unallocated from a VM
		Not returned to free memory until completely scrubbed
		
Dedicated Instances vs Dedicated Hosts
	Dedicated Instances
		Physically Isolated from hardware level from other guests which belong to other AWS accounts
		May share hardware with other non dedicated instances from SAME account
		On demand
		RI save 70% off
		spot save 90% off
	
	Dedicated Hosts
		Physical server dedicated to you
		Gives additional visibility/control on how VMs are placed
		Allows server-bound software licenses to be used
		Used for compliance and regulatory rules
		billed per hosts
		
AWS Systems Manager - EC2 Run
	Manage a large number of AWS VMs and On Prem
	Automate common admin tasks and adhoc config changes
	Without logging in to the instances
	
	Steps
		Need to create IAM Role with policy EC2 Role for SSM
		Launch EC2 with that role or attach role to existing ec2
		Click Run command
		Select command
		Select instance manually or via tags
		Type properties JSON - optional
		enable SNS notification once it runs - optional
		
	SSM agent needs to be installed to the instance
	Commands and parameters are defined in a Systems Manager Document
	Commands can be issued via
		AWS Console
		AWS CLI
		AWS Tools for Powershell
		Systems Manager API
		Amazon SDKs

	Parameter Store
		securely put confidential data on instances at boot time
		Under EC2 Systems Manager Shared Resources
		Steps
			Create Parameter
			Key Value Pair
				String
				String List - comma separated string
				Secure String - encrypted using AWS KMS Default
		
		Parameter can be passed to different AWS services
			Lambda
			CloudFormation
			EC2
			EC2 Run

AWS Config - S3 Lab Notes
	s3 bucket public write prohibited
	s3 bucket public read prohibited
	
Secure S3 using pre-signed URLs
	Normally Using SDKs (Python, Java, Go)
	Steps
		Create EC2 with role s3adminaccess
		aws s3 presign s3://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME --expires-in TIME_IN_SECONDS (default is 3600)
		will return an https link
		The https link will allow the object to be accessible in public
		
AWS Inspector vs AWS Trusted Advisor
	Inspector
		Automated VA tool
		
		How it works
			Create assessment target
			Install agent on ec2 instance
			Create assessment template
			Perform assessment run
			Review Findings against rules
		
		Steps:
			Create Inspector Role - allows ec2 describe all
			Tag your ec2 targets
			Install AWS Agent
				Shell command
				AWS Systems Manager
			Define the target tags
			Define an assessment template
				Name of the assessment
				Premade Rule packages
					CIS
				Duration 1 hour recommended
			Run the assessment template
		
		Can download the report via html or pdf
		Can Create Master templates
			Can add more than 1 rules package
	
	Trusted Advisor
		Optimization of AWS environment
			cost optimization - business/enterprise
			performance
			security
			Fault Tolerance - business/enterprise
		
		2 versions - Dependent on support plan 
			Core checks only and recommendations
			Full trusted advisor for business/enterprise

Shared Responsibility Model
	AWS Responsibilities
		global infra
		hardware, software, networking, facilities
		managed services
		Systems that you do not have access to (RDS Instance)
		Managed services that you do not have access to view the application (dynamodb lambda etc.)
	Customer Security Responsibilities
		IAAS
		updates and security patches
		configuration of AWS provided firewall
		
	The model changes for different service types:
		Infrastructure
			Compute Services
			Build Cloud Infrastructure
				
		Container
			RDS EMR and Elastic Beanstalk
			Services run on a compute resource that customer does not have access to
			Customer is responsible for
				Platform level IAM
				network controls
				firewall rules
		
		Abstracted
			AWS Manages the application and the Infrastructure
			Customer manages application level IAM
			
	YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THINGS YOU CAN CONTROL

Other Security Aspects
	Security groups are stateful - keeps track of connection state inbound == outbound
	You need to be able to read security group rules
	When you want to find out who provisions stuff
		Cloudtrail
		Athena
		
	AWS Artifact
		on demand download of AWS security and compliance documents AKA audit artifacts
		used to be submitted to auditors and regulators to show AWS compliance
		
	CloudHSM vs KMS
		Key Control is customer only for HSM, AWS and customer for KMS
		You cannot create pub/priv keypair using KMS, only cloud HSM due to asymmetric nature
		CloudHSM now has utility/metered billing no longer 5k usd per month
		
	Encryption
		S3	- Instant just turn on encryption
		
		DynamoDB, RDS, EFS, EBS - Encryption with Migration
